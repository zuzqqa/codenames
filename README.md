## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Codenames is a distributed game inspired by the popular board game **"Codenames"** (Tajniacy). This project is being developed as part of a group project for the **Gdańsk University of Technology**. The current version includes both a frontend (React with TypeScript) and a backend (Spring Boot) that can communicate over a network to simulate the gameplay.

In the future, we plan to expand this application into a mobile version and possibly integrate with other platforms.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
* Docker - For containerization of both backend and frontend applications.
* Docker Compose - For running the applications locally using Docker.

Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already:

```
https://www.docker.com/get-started
```

### Installing

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/zuzqqa/codenames.git
cd codenames
```

2. Set up the .env file in the root directory to define necessary environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables)).

3. Run the application using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

The backend and frontend should now be running locally. You can access the frontend at http://localhost:5173 and the backend will be available through its API.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Currently, the project is in early development, and automated tests are not yet implemented. However, we plan to add testing frameworks (such as JUnit for the backend and Jest for the frontend) in the future.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To start the game, open the frontend application in your browser. The gameplay will be conducted between multiple players, with the game logic managed by the backend.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

The most recent releases of the frontend and backend are available as Docker images on Docker Hub. You can find them under the following links:

* [Frontend Docker Image] (https://hub.docker.com/r/codenames/codenames-frontend)
* [Backend Docker Image] (https://hub.docker.com/r/codenames/codenames-backend)

In the future, we will deploy the application to cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## 🌍 Environment Variables <a name = "environment_variables"></a>

The following environment variables are required to run the project:

* SECRET: JWT secret key for token generation (needed for secure authentication).
* SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME: Username for sending emails.
* SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD: Password for the mail account.
* MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: Root username for MongoDB initialization.
* MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: Root password for MongoDB initialization.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define these variables as follows:

```
SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=your_mongo_root_username
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mongo_root_password
```

Alternatively, you can set these variables directly in your system as environment variables.
