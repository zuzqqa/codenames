**🚧 What's still under development?**
- As always, perfection takes time — some features are still being polished, and a few rough edges are part of the charm of progress. We’re continuing to improve the site’s responsiveness across all devices, though screen size seems to be evolving faster than design specs. While we refine the experience, we trust in our users’ remarkable ability to uncover the unexpected before we even finish writing the test cases.We appreciate the early feedback (especially the passionate kind), and remind everyone that a living product evolves — sometimes in surprising directions. Stay tuned for updates, improvements, and the occasional “oh, that wasn’t supposed to happen.”

⚠️Important! This version is intended for testers and developers. Please note that the game is not fully functional yet, and some elements may not behave as expected.
